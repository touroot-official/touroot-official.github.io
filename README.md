Getting started your blog with gatsby-starter-hoodie by following steps below. It's very easy ðŸ˜‰.

## 1. Create a Gatsby site

> Make sure you have **node.js** and **gatsby-cli** installed on your computer.

```
$ npx gatsby new my-hoodie-blog https://github.com/devHudi/gatsby-starter-hoodie
```

## 2. Start dev server

```
$ cd my-hoodie-blog
$ npm run start
```

Now you can access to your blog at localhost:8000.

## 3. Create your own Github repository

Utterance comment widget is based on **Github issue system**. So you need your own GitHub repository. Also, if you want to publish your blog through Github Pages or Netlify, the Github Repository is a necessary.

If you don't know how to create a GitHub repository, follow the [official GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo).

### Add remote repository

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/{YOUR_GITHUB_NAME}/{YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME}
```

## 4. Write blog-config.js

```javascript
module.exports = {
  title: "MY BLOG",
  description: "Hello, This is my blog",
  author: "YOUR NAME",
  siteUrl: "https://myblog.com",
  links: {
    github: "https://github.com",
    facebook: "https://www.facebook.com",
    instagram: "https://www.instagram.com",
    etc: "https://www.google.com/",
  },
  utterances: {
    repo: "{YOUR_GITHUB_NAME}/{YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME}",
    type: "pathname",
  },
}
```

gatsby-starter-hoodie provides a configuration file called `blog-config.js`. In this file, you can configure blog, biography (profile), and utterance.

Configure `blog-config.js` to suit your blog. However, it is recommended not to modify `utterances.type`.

## 6. Deploy your blog

### 6-1 via Netlify

<a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Netlify"></a>

Follow the Connecting to Netlify steps in [A Step-by-Step Guide: Gatsby on Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/02/24/a-step-by-step-guide-gatsby-on-netlify/). It's not difficult.

If you connect the github repository using Netlify, it is automatically distributed whenever you push it, so it is convenient.

### 6-2. via Github Pages

#### Case 1

If the repository name is in the form of `{YOUR_GITHUB_NAME} .github.io`, run it below.

```
$ npm run deploy-gh
```

#### Case 2

If the repository name is not in the form of `{YOUR_GITHUB_NAME} .github.io`, run it below.

```
$ npm run deploy-gh-prefix-paths
```

In the above case, you need to change `pathPrefix` in `gatsby-config.js` to your repository name.

### 6-3. other platforms
